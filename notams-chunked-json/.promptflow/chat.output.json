  "answer": "Based on the available NOTAMs data, here is a summary of the relevant information:\n\n1. YBBN (Brisbane Airport):\n   - TWY L is closed due to work in progress. TWY C12, C13, and J are also closed. Exceptions can be made with 15 minutes prior notice. Contact telephone number: (07) 3406 3072.\n   - There are restrictions on turns from TWY L onto TWY C13 and TWY C13 onto TWY L. These turns are only allowed under tow due to reduced fillet pavement. \n\n2. YMML (Melbourne Airport):\n   - RWY 09/27 is closed due to work in progress. Refer to the Method of Working Plan 2023-4 Stage R1 for more details.\n   - TWY M, N, P (north of TWY E), Q (north of TWY E), and E (west of RWY 16/34) are closed due to work in progress. Refer to the Method of Working Plan 2023-4 Stage R1 for more details.\n   - RWY 16/34 has an ungrooved patch between 1170m and 1190m from RWY 34 threshold.\n   - RWY 09/27 has an ungrooved patched area between the RWY 27 threshold and TWY A due to work in progress.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no NOTAMs available specifically for instrument approach procedures or departures and approaches for YBBN East.\n\nConsidering the greater circle distance, you may also want to consider checking for NOTAMs at airports in the vicinity of YBCG (Gold Coast Airport) and YSCH (Coffs Harbour Airport) for any relevant information.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!"
